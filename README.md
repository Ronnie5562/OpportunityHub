# OpportunityHub
A basic menu-driven application that links job seekers to suitable job platforms(indeed, invisible, etc.) according to the job they want and also connects entry-level job seekers to mentors.
BSE project
  Our mission's focus is Job creation, and our project is a menu-driven application that links job seekers to job platforms according to the jobs they want. This application will help people land jobs. This application will have prompts requesting user inputs such as names, job interests, experience levels, and skills to link them up to jobs available. Also, we will link job-seekers who have yet to gain experience to people of higher experience to mentor them.

OpportunityHub is a simple and user-friendly menu-driven application designed to assist job seekers in finding suitable job platforms such as Indeed, LinkedIn, and 
others based on their specific job preferences. Additionally, the application aims to connect entry-level job seekers with experienced mentors who can provide guidance 
and support in their career journey.

OpportunityHub seeks to bridge the gap between job seekers and job platforms while fostering a supportive community for those embarking on their professional journey.
